The ""Second Horse"" strategy involves investing in the second-best companies within a sector rather than the market leaders. This approach can uncover hidden potential and significant returns as these companies grow and capture market share.

▎Why Consider the ""Second Horse""?

1. Untapped Potential: Second-tier companies often have room to grow and innovate, making them attractive investments.

2. Real-World Examples: 

   • CoForge has outperformed giants like TCS and Infosys.

   • Torrent Power has shown strong performance compared to Tata Power.

3. Wisdom of Experts: Investors like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch emphasize looking beyond the obvious choices to find value.

▎Conclusion

Authors and Traders Supporting 2-3x Returns

1. William J. O'Neil (How to Make Money in Stocks):
O'Neil advocates for identifying quality stocks with realistic growth potential and emphasizes taking profits when a stock appreciates by 20-30% or doubles, ensuring consistent gains while managing risk.


2. George Soros (The Alchemy of Finance):
Soros famously said, ""It’s not about whether you’re right or wrong, but how much money you make when you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong."" This aligns with achieving steady compounding returns rather than chasing astronomical growth.


3. Ray Dalio (Principles):
Dalio emphasizes diversification and sustainable growth, promoting a balanced, disciplined approach to wealth building rather than high-risk strategies aimed at extreme returns.


4. Stanley Druckenmiller:
Druckenmiller consistently highlights the importance of capital preservation and compounding wealth over time, rather than risking it all on speculative bets.


5. Mark Minervini (Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard):
Minervini advises locking in profits at reasonable milestones and avoiding overexposure, stressing that moderate, repeatable gains compound effectively over time.


6. Philip Fisher (Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits):
Fisher emphasizes investing in quality companies with consistent growth prospects, which are more likely to double or triple in value over time rather than deliver outsized returns.


7. Howard Marks (The Most Important Thing):
Marks advocates for risk-adjusted returns and warns against chasing speculative gains. His investment philosophy revolves around maintaining realistic expectations and compounding wealth gradually.


8. Charlie Munger:
Munger, Warren Buffett's partner, is known for saying, ""The big money is not in the buying and the selling, but in the waiting."" This reflects a focus on achievable, long-term returns like 2-3x rather than extreme outcomes.

While none of the authors explicitly mention about exact 2-3x returns over investment. They also would have advised to average upwards or pyramid winners then your overall gains would look something different. 

But this reference is more or less in line with what realistic expectations one must have over 3-5-7 year horizon from stock market.

🔸 RBI is expected to keep benchmark Repo rate unchanged in its today's MPC meeting. 

🔸 However, CRR cut is expected to ease off liquidity and elevated short term rates. 

🔸 India’s Q2 GDP growth was below estimate and slowdown is broadbased.

🔸 MPC would have to revise its FY25 growth forecast significantly lower from 7.2% YoY as growth in H1 is only 6% now. 

🔸 Even as higher inflation is a headwind to cut repo rate immediately, it should not impede RBI from giving forward guidance and providing an accommodative liquidity stance.

**View**

🔸 A 50-bps cut in CRR would infuse liquidity of ~₹ 1.2 lakh crore in the banking system which will aid lenders in current scenario with constraints of liabilities accretion. 

🔸 Thus, any cut in CRR is seen to remain positive for lenders.

2024-12-05 02:52:01+00:00,-1001222486878,"The Easiest Way to Find Strong Stocks After a Market Correction #tradingknowledge 

When markets correct (up to 10%), identifying strong stocks that can lead the next rally becomes crucial. Here’s a simple and effective method to filter such stocks:


---

Steps to Identify Strong Stocks

1. Focus on Stocks Near Their Highs:
Look for stocks that are trading close to their 52-week highs or recent peaks, even during a market correction. This indicates strength.


2. Monitor Gains When the Index Stabilizes:
After the market (e.g., Nifty 50) stabilizes, observe stocks that begin to rise with the market. These are likely leaders of the next rally.


3. Look for Recovery Signs in Moving Averages:

Watch for a flat or rising moving average line (e.g., 50-day or 200-day).

Check if the price stays above the moving average, which signals strength and recovery.



4. High Relative Strength:
Stocks that fall less than the index during corrections and gain faster as the market recovers typically have positive relative strength, a key factor for future outperformance.




---

Examples of Strong Stocks

Banking Sector:

HDFC Bank and Federal Bank have shown resilience in the recent market.


Hospitals and Medical Equipment:

Stocks in this sector have performed well even in a challenging market.


Metals:

National Aluminum has displayed strength, falling less than its peers.

IT: Coforge consistency in uptrend

---

Why These Stocks?

These stocks demonstrate high relative strength, meaning they perform better than their index or sector during downturns of Oct-Nov 2024 and recover faster when the market stabilizes.


---

Recommended Reading

For a deeper understanding, read Stan Weinstein's ""How to Make Money in Bull and Bear Markets"". It explains relative strength and market trends in detail.


---

2024-11-26 16:22:59+00:00,-1001222486878,"Understanding Total Traded Volume: Why It’s Not Separated into Buy and Sell Volume

In the financial markets, total traded volume is one of the most widely used metrics by traders and investors. It represents the total number of shares, contracts, or units traded during a specific time period. While many assume it can easily be split into ""buy"" and ""sell"" volumes, the reality is more nuanced.

What Does Volume Represent?
Volume is the sum of all executed trades, regardless of whether the buyer or seller initiated the transaction. For every trade, there is both a buyer and a seller—one party agrees to purchase at a price, and another agrees to sell. Hence, each trade adds equally to the total volume, making it impossible to directly classify volume into discrete buy or sell categories.

Why Isn’t Volume Split into Buy and Sell?

Market Mechanics: The financial market operates through matching orders—market orders (to buy or sell immediately) and limit orders (to buy or sell at a specific price). Every completed trade involves one of each. Thus, whether a trade is initiated by a buyer or seller is context-dependent.
Bid-Ask Dynamics: A trade at the ask price might suggest buying pressure, while a trade at the bid price might indicate selling pressure. However, this is only an inference and doesn’t conclusively divide volume.

Insights from a Leading Expert
Well-known financial writer John Murphy, in his book Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets, explains:


""Volume represents the activity of the market but doesn’t differentiate between buying and selling. It’s the magnitude of participation that matters, which often signals conviction or lack thereof in price movements.""

This insight underscores that volume analysis isn’t about who is buying or selling—it’s about understanding the intensity and interest in the market.

Key Takeaways for Traders

Interpret Volume Contextually: Combine volume analysis with price action. For example, rising prices with high volume suggest strong buying interest, while falling prices with high volume may indicate heavy selling.
Use Tools for Estimation: Tools like Volume Delta or Order Flow Analytics can approximate buy and sell volumes but should be used with caution as they rely on assumptions.
Focus on Trends: Volume trends often reveal more than the split. A consistent increase in volume may signal a breakout, while decreasing volume during a rally may indicate weakening momentum.

Understanding volume’s role without overcomplicating its components is crucial for developing effective trading strategies. Share this insight with your audience to highlight the importance of clear and informed volume interpretation in their trading journey!

What does that mean? 

The phrase ""Knowledge comes but wisdom lingers"" suggests that while knowledge can be acquired quickly through learning, experience, or information, wisdom is something that develops over time and endures. Knowledge refers to facts and information, while wisdom involves the ability to apply that knowledge judiciously and thoughtfully in real-life situations. 

In essence, you can gain knowledge rapidly, but true wisdom requires reflection, experience, and a deeper understanding of life’s complexities. Wisdom often remains with us longer because it is shaped by our experiences and the lessons we learn along the way.

In the ever-evolving world of trading, understanding the distinction between swing trading and positional trading is crucial for traders aiming to optimize their strategies. While swing trades often rely heavily on technical analysis and chart patterns, positional trading necessitates a blend of both technical and fundamental analysis. This guide will delve into these two approaches, offering detailed steps, examples, and key considerations for traders.

▎Swing Trading: Technical Analysis Focus

Swing trading involves holding positions for a few days to weeks, capitalizing on short- to medium-term price movements. Traders primarily use technical analysis to identify entry and exit points.

Key Steps in Swing Trading:

1. Identify Trends: Use moving averages (e.g., 50-day and 200-day) to determine the overall market trend.
   - Author: Alexander Elder emphasizes the importance of trend identification in his book *""Trading for a Living.""*

2. Chart Patterns: Look for specific patterns such as head and shoulders, double tops/bottoms, or flags.
   - Example: A trader might identify a bullish flag pattern, indicating a potential upward breakout.

3. Technical Indicators: Utilize indicators like RSI (Relative Strength Index) and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) to confirm entry signals.
   - Example: An RSI below 30 might suggest an oversold condition, indicating a potential buy opportunity.

4. Set Entry and Exit Points: Establish clear stop-loss and take-profit levels based on support and resistance levels.
   - Tip: A common strategy is to set a stop-loss at 1-2% below the entry price.

5. Monitor Market Conditions: Stay updated on market news that could impact your trades.

▎Positional Trading: A Blend of Technical and Fundamental Analysis

Positional trading, on the other hand, involves holding positions for weeks to months, focusing on long-term trends. This approach combines technical analysis with fundamental insights about the underlying asset.

Key Steps in Positional Trading:

1. Fundamental Analysis: Evaluate the company's financial health, industry position, and macroeconomic factors.
   - Author: Benjamin Graham's *""The Intelligent Investor""* provides foundational principles for assessing a company's value.

2. Technical Analysis: Use long-term charts (daily, weekly) to identify significant trends and patterns.
   - Example: A trader may observe a long-term uptrend in a stock's price supported by consistent earnings growth.

3. Market Sentiment: Gauge market sentiment through news articles, earnings reports, and analyst ratings.
   - Tip: Following reputable financial news outlets can provide insights into market sentiment shifts.

4. Risk Management: Establish a risk management plan that includes diversification across sectors or asset classes.
   - Example: If investing in tech stocks, consider also holding some defensive stocks or bonds to mitigate risk.

5. Review and Adjust: Regularly review your positions and adjust based on new information or changing market conditions.
   - Strategy: Consider using trailing stops to lock in profits while allowing for further upside.

▎Conclusion

Both swing trading and positional trading have their unique advantages and challenges. Swing traders thrive on short-term movements driven by technical analysis, while positional traders benefit from a comprehensive understanding of both technical and fundamental factors.

Stop Loss Hit: You exit in full only if your stop loss is hit after entry. The first stop loss is the best stop loss. The point is to exit from bad trade early and stay afloat in the sea of the market, your job is not to sink by taking a big loss.

Winning Trade: When the position is in decent profit after a quick move, such as 10-15%, you can book 30% of your open position to make it a winning trade. This gives you a psychological advantage of staying in a winning trade and following predefined entry/exit plans.

Later, you can pyramid on pullbacks with a tight stop loss if it starts making higher highs and higher lows (HH-HL).

Selling in Strength: When the price moves rapidly up and is too much stretched/far away from moving averages like the 13EMA or multiple negative divergences are seen on MACD/RSI on daily charts, you can cut 40-50%. This involves booking a part in the strong trend of the stock.

Weakening Trend: A close below a short-term moving average like the 13EMA should be a signal to cut 30-40% of open positions.

Trend Change: A swing break means the stock has started making lower lows and lower highs (LL-LH) and is below the 13EMA.

2024-03-08 18:30:02+00:00,-1001222486878,"Overtrading refers to excessive buying and selling of financial assets, often driven by emotions such as fear, greed, or the need for excitement. This behavior can lead to a higher frequency of trades than necessary, increased transaction costs, and ultimately, reduced returns for the trader.

The psychology behind overtrading can be attributed to several factors:

1. Emotional trading: Traders may become emotionally attached to their positions, leading them to make impulsive decisions based on fear of missing out or the desire to recoup losses quickly.

2. Gambling mentality: Some traders view the market as a form of gambling and seek the thrill of making frequent trades, even if it is not in their best interest financially.

3. Overconfidence: Overconfident traders may believe they have superior insight or skills that enable them to outperform the market through frequent trading.

4. Addiction: Trading can become addictive for some individuals, leading to compulsive behavior and an inability to control their trading impulses.

When a trader overtrades, the biggest beneficiary is typically the broker or platform through which the trades are executed. Brokers earn commissions or spreads on each trade, so more trading activity means more revenue for them.

To avoid losses from overtrading, traders can take the following steps:

1. Develop a trading plan: Establish clear criteria for entering and exiting trades based on a well-defined strategy rather than emotional impulses.

2. Set trading goals: Define specific, achievable goals for your trading activities and stick to them to avoid unnecessary trades.

3. Practice discipline: Avoid making impulsive decisions by sticking to your trading plan and avoiding emotional reactions to market fluctuations.

4. Monitor your trading activity: Keep track of your trades and evaluate their performance regularly to identify patterns of overtrading and make adjustments as needed.

5. Limit your trading frequency: Set a maximum number of trades per day or week to prevent yourself from succumbing to the temptation of overtrading.

By understanding the psychological factors driving overtrading and implementing strategies to mitigate these behaviors, traders can improve their overall performance and avoid unnecessary losses in the market.

Stop Loss Hit: You exit in full only if your stop loss is hit after entry. The first stop loss is the best stop loss. The point is to exit from bad trade early and stay afloat in the sea of the market, your job is not to sink by taking a big loss.

Winning Trade: When the position is in decent profit after a quick move, such as 10-15%, you can book 30% of your open position to make it a winning trade. This gives you a psychological advantage of staying in a winning trade and following predefined entry/exit plans.

Later, you can pyramid on pullbacks with a tight stop loss if it starts making higher highs and higher lows (HH-HL).

Selling in Strength: When the price moves rapidly up and is too much stretched/far away from moving averages like the 13EMA or multiple negative divergences are seen on MACD/RSI on daily charts, you can cut 40-50%. This involves booking a part in the strong trend of the stock.

Weakening Trend: A close below a short-term moving average like the 13EMA should be a signal to cut 30-40% of open positions.

Trend Change: A swing break means the stock has started making lower lows and lower highs (LL-LH) and is below the 13EMA.

**Target-based trading vs Trailed stop-loss based trading** are two different approaches to managing trades in the financial markets. 

In target-based trading, traders set a specific price level at which they will take profits on a trade. Once the price reaches the target level, the trader closes the position and locks in their gains. This approach allows traders to have a clear profit objective and helps them to avoid getting greedy and holding onto a  trade for too long.

On the other hand, trailed stop-loss based trading involves setting a stop-loss order that moves in line with the price of the asset. As the price moves in the trader's favor, the stop-loss order is adjusted to lock in profits and protect against potential losses. This approach allows traders to let their profits run while also protecting themselves from sudden market reversals.

The choice between target-based trading and trailed stop-loss based trading ultimately depends on a trader's individual trading style, risk tolerance, and market conditions. Some traders may prefer target-based trading for its simplicity and clear profit objectives, while others may prefer trailed stop-loss based trading for its ability to capture larger gains in trending markets.

In general, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to which approach is better. It is important for traders to experiment with both strategies and determine which one works best for them based on their own preferences and trading goals.

2024-02-11 09:40:54+00:00,-1001222486878,"Here are details about four types of G**aps** in detail:

1. Common Gaps:
- Common gaps are the most frequent type of gap in the market and are usually caused by normal market fluctuations.
- These gaps do not necessarily signal a significant change in market sentiment or trend direction.
- Common gaps can occur due to overnight news, earnings reports, or other factors that impact market participants' behavior.
- Traders may not give as much weight to common gaps compared to other types of gaps when making trading decisions.

2. Breakaway Gaps:
- Breakaway gaps occur at the beginning of a new trend and signal a strong shift in market sentiment.
- These gaps are often accompanied by high trading volume, indicating increased interest and participation in the market.
- Breakaway gaps can serve as confirmation of a new trend and provide traders with an opportunity to enter positions in alignment with the gap's direction.
- Traders may use breakaway gaps as a signal to initiate or add to positions based on the strength of the gap.

3. Runaway/Measuring Gaps:
- Runaway or measuring gaps occur in the middle of a trend and serve as continuation signals, suggesting that the current trend is likely to persist.
- These gaps often occur after a significant price movement in the direction of the prevailing trend.
- Runaway gaps are also known as measuring gaps because they provide an estimate of the potential distance the price may move in the direction of the trend.
- Traders can use runaway gaps to assess the strength of the current trend and potentially adjust their positions based on the gap's implications for future price movement.

4. Exhaustion Gaps:
- Exhaustion gaps occur near the end of a trend and signal that the current price movement may be reaching its limit.
- These gaps often occur after a prolonged trend or significant price movement, indicating that market participants may be exhausted or overextended.
- Exhaustion gaps can serve as a warning sign that a reversal or correction may be imminent, prompting traders to consider taking profits or adjusting their positions accordingly.
- Traders may use exhaustion gaps as a signal to monitor for potential trend reversals and be cautious about entering new positions in the direction of the exhausted trend.

I always use TechnoFundamental approach to find stock. Though need to streamline and document it for better understanding so here is short version of it.

📌 **Based on Technicals.** 
Entry is always based on Technicals and main criteria is Price and Volume, people's footprints are on chart. 

__Volume scanners on Chartink sites__: 
Scan based on Volume and look weekly chart to find out potential reversal zones or breakout then enter on daily pullback towards 13ema. 

__Chart Patterns Search__: Inverse Head and shoulders pattern(BSE) , Rounding Bottom and most favorite Falling Wedge(ndtv, idea, suzlon, nmdc, HindCopper etc had this pattern): These are potential turnaround companies which mostly will have everything bad in numbers but something planned by management or favorable economic conditions in immediate few months that will turn it around and make them profitable. E.g. BSE post covid got profits from IPOs. Metal companies got loans on lower rates and demand boosted post lockdown etc.

📌 **Quantitative and Qualitative analysis(fundamentals):** Though most of my scans are based on Technical some short term are based on fundamentals search too. 

__Quantitative or Statistical analysis__: look for continuous sales rise and better than others in sector, eps must be positive(negative eps then ignore it), no share pledge or in some rare case after study it should be less than 20%, debt lowest in the the sector, debt to equity <1, ROCE and ROE must be highest in sector. Decent price to book value compared to other in sector and sometimes FII stake increase decrease.

These are least parameters you can to check

__Qualitative Analysis__: This involves checking management vision like new product launch or expansion of business or new acquisitions, then if company has competitive and economic advantage against others etc. These details you will get in news or in concall or Investor presentation shared by company. 

This is main part and most overlooked by people is Qualitative analysis this will give you confidence about companies future and holding for longer term.

Stop Loss Hit: You exit in full only if your stop loss is hit after entry. The first stop loss is the best stop loss. The point is to exit from bad trade early and stay afloat in the sea of the market, your job is not to sink by taking a big loss.

Winning Trade: When the position is in decent profit after a quick move, such as 10-15%, you can book 30% of your open position to make it a winning trade. This gives you a psychological advantage of staying in a winning trade and following predefined entry/exit plans.

Later, you can pyramid on pullbacks with a tight stop loss if it starts making higher highs and higher lows (HH-HL).

Selling in Strength: When the price moves rapidly up and is too much stretched/far away from moving averages like the 13EMA or multiple negative divergences are seen on MACD/RSI on daily charts, you can cut 40-50%. This involves booking a part in the strong trend of the stock. This day is usually day when stock makes biggest candle in entire rally or hit 20% circuit book on such day. #TATAINVEST is example which you can get on this channel. 

Weakening Trend: A close below a short-term moving average like the 13EMA should be a signal to cut 30-40% of open positions. To identify this look for multiple days back to back red candles taking stock below 13ema. 

Trend Change: A swing break means the stock has started making lower lows and lower highs (LL-LH) and is below the 13EMA. Here, booking full of open positions is a good option. #tradingknowledge #EXIT #ExitStrategy",in swing and positional cash trading you might have a question about when to exit a trade well there is no single answer and method for it here are some step that guide you on not exiting in full but doing so in tranche stop loss hit you exit in full only if your stop loss is hit after entry the first stop loss is the best stop loss the point is to exit from bad trade early and stay afloat in the sea of the market your job is not to sink by taking a big loss winning trade when the position is in decent profit after a quick move such a 1015 you can book 30 of your open position to make it a winning trade this give you a psychological advantage of staying in a winning trade and following predefined entryexit plan later you can pyramid on pullback with a tight stop loss if it start making higher high and higher low hhhl selling in strength when the price move rapidly up and is too much stretchedfar away from moving average like the 13ema or multiple negative divergence are seen on macdrsi on daily chart you can cut 4050 this involves booking a part in the strong trend of the stock this day is usually day when stock make biggest candle in entire rally or hit 20 circuit book on such day tatainvest is example which you can get on this channel weakening trend a close below a shortterm moving average like the 13ema should be a signal to cut 3040 of open position to identify this look for multiple day back to back red candle taking stock below 13ema trend change a swing break mean the stock ha started making lower low and lower high lllh and is below the 13ema here booking full of open position is a good option tradingknowledge exit exitstrategy,-0.86,0.09886904761904765,-0.38056547619047615,Positive,0,0,0,0,0

Breakout stock buy refers to buying a stock when it breaks out from a significant resistance level, often accompanied by high volume. This strategy aims to capture a significant price move resulting from a breakout and is popular among traders seeking quick profits. The advantage of breakout stock buy is the potential for significant gains in a short period of time. However, the disadvantage is the risk of false breakouts and high volatility, which can lead to losses if the stock fails to sustain the breakout.

On the other hand, pullback buy strategy involves buying a stock after it has experienced a temporary dip or pullback from its recent high. This strategy aims to benefit from the stock's potential bounce back and continuation of its upward trend. The advantage of pullback buy is the opportunity to enter at a relatively lower price and ride the upward momentum. However, the disadvantage is the risk of mistaking a pullback for a trend reversal, leading to losses if the stock continues to decline.

In summary, breakout stock buy offers the potential for quick gains but comes with high volatility and risk of false breakouts, while pullback buy allows for entering at a lower price but requires caution to avoid mistaking a pullback for a trend reversal.",good morning tradingknowledge breakout v pullback buy breakout stock buy refers to buying a stock when it break out from a significant resistance level often accompanied by high volume this strategy aim to capture a significant price move resulting from a breakout and is popular among trader seeking quick profit the advantage of breakout stock buy is the potential for significant gain in a short period of time however the disadvantage is the risk of false breakout and high volatility which can lead to loss if the stock fails to sustain the breakout on the other hand pullback buy strategy involves buying a stock after it ha experienced a temporary dip or pullback from it recent high this strategy aim to benefit from the stock potential bounce back and continuation of it upward trend the advantage of pullback buy is the opportunity to enter at a relatively lower price and ride the upward momentum however the disadvantage is the risk of mistaking a pullback for a trend reversal leading to loss if the stock continues to decline in summary breakout stock buy offer the potential for quick gain but come with high volatility and risk of false breakout while pullback buy allows for entering at a lower price but requires caution to avoid mistaking a pullback for a trend reversal,-0.4678,0.13507246376811596,-0.166363768115942,Positive,0,0,0,0,0

Dow, the founder of the Wall Street Journal, and his partner Edward Jones. The theory is based on the analysis of the stock market and is considered one of the foundational principles of technical analysis.

The Dow Theory is comprised of six basic tenets:

1. The market discounts everything: This principle suggests that all known information about a stock, industry, or the overall market is already reflected in the price. Therefore, the price movement itself is the most important indicator.

2. The market has three trends: The Dow Theory identifies three primary trends in the stock market – the primary trend, the secondary trend, and the minor trend. The primary trend represents the long-term direction of the market, while the secondary trend consists of corrections against the primary trend. The minor trend is short-term fluctuations within the secondary trend.

3. The market averages must confirm each other: According to this principle, for a trend to be considered valid, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Dow Jones Transportation Average must move in the same direction. If one average moves in one direction and the other does not follow, it could signal a potential reversal.

4. Volume should confirm the trend: This principle states that volume should increase in the direction of the primary trend. If the volume decreases while prices are rising or falling, it may indicate a weakening trend.

5. A trend is assumed to be in effect until it gives definite signals that it has reversed: The Dow Theory suggests that trends tend to persist and should be assumed to continue until there is clear evidence of a reversal.

6. Trends have three phases: According to Dow Theory, trends are made up of three phases – accumulation, public participation, and distribution. During the accumulation phase, informed investors begin buying or selling stocks. In the public participation phase, general market participants start to join in, driving prices higher or lower. Finally, during the distribution phase, informed investors start to unwind their positions.

📌Breakout stock buy is when a trader purchases a stock that has broken out of a key resistance level, signaling a potential upward trend. This strategy allows for buying at the beginning of a potential rally, with the advantage of potentially capturing significant gains. However, the disadvantage is that breakouts can sometimes be false signals, leading to losses if the stock reverses.

📌 Pullback buy is when a trader purchases a stock that has experienced a temporary decline within an overall uptrend. This strategy allows for buying at a lower price after a brief dip, with the advantage of potentially getting a better entry point and reducing risk. However, the disadvantage is that the stock may continue to decline further.

In above example breakout buy failed however pullback buy will provide you entry with minimal stop opportunity of 6%.

📌Fundamentally it was in bad shape It was earning nominal fees with IPO lunches. But if one thinks by Qualitative analysis perspective it's never ending business. 

📌 As NSE wasn't getting listed soon due to legal case by SEBI on  Co-location case, so i held it.

📌 Then came news of it's share split that moved price significantly higher on 21st mar 2022 it split 1:3.

📌 The stock then started dropping sharp after split date. After 1 year by Mar 2023 it dropped by 60%. I had hopes sooner or later it will come up with strong steps to boost volumes and launch FnO segment so I held it.

📌On 15th May 2023 it launched sensex and bankex FnO with Friday expiry. When I read about it now, It was smart move as NSE usually had very low liquidity in options on Friday. With expiry on Friday BSE got liquidity.

📌 The run up post May 2023 is spectacular and it rose by 340% At CMP 2170 on 25th Nov 2023 i am sitting on 903% gain for after split average of 216.28 🤑

*1. Stay calm and avoid panic selling:* It is important to stay calm and avoid panic selling during a market downturn. Panic selling is often one of the biggest mistakes that investors make.

*2. Asset Allocation Rebalancing:* Rebalancing your portfolio regularly helps to ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your investment objectives and risk tolerance.

*3. Follow your Financial Plan:* Stay invested as per your financial goals and required asset class. Do not change your risk profiles with market movements.

*4. Focus on Long Term Investing:* Equity is an asset class for your long term financial goals.

*5. Have Realistic Expectations from Equity Asset Class:* 12% (Real GDP + Retail Inflation) is a realistic expectation from equity asset class.

*6. Limit Your Exposure to Financial News:*  It can be tempting to follow every news story about the stock market, but this can be counterproductive. 

Too much exposure to financial news can lead to anxiety and stress, which can impair your decision-making. Instead, focus on reading a few reputable financial publications each day and avoid reading sensationalistic headlines.

*7. Avoid Social Media:* Social media can be a breeding ground for Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt.

When the market is falling, it's easy to get caught up in the negative sentiment and make impulsive decisions. Avoid reading financial discussions on social media and focus on staying positive.

*8. Do Not Check your Portfolio on a Daily Basis*
